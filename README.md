## What This Shows

This visualization maps **$557,952,981** in documented wire transfers across **141 entities** and **382 transactions** from approximately 2009–2019. Entities include individuals, shell companies, law firms, trusts, and financial institutions connected to Jeffrey Epstein.

The data has been categorized by confidence level:

| Color | Source Tier | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Solid cyan** | `verified_wires` | Directly from official court exhibits (Exhibits A–E) |
| **Dashed green** | `audited_PROVEN` | Forensically audited — high confidence |
| **Dashed gold** | `audited_STRONG` | Strong supporting evidence |
| **Dotted orange** | `audited_MODERATE` | Moderate confidence, flagged for further review |

## How to Use the Visualization

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| `⌘K` or click search bar | Search any entity by name |
| **Single click** a node | Highlight all direct connections |
| **Double-click** a node | Open full detail panel (inflow, outflow, transactions) |
| **Scroll** | Zoom in/out — more labels appear at higher zoom |
| **Drag** | Pan around the graph |
| **Filter panel** (left) | Filter by tier, exhibit, amount range, date range, bank involvement |
| **Reset** button | Clear all filters |

### Reading the graph
- **Node size** = total money flow through that entity (bigger = more money)
- **Edge thickness** = transaction amount (log scale)
- **Arrow direction** = money flows FROM → TO
- **Edge style** = data confidence tier (see table above)
- Multiple transactions between the same two entities are collapsed into one edge — click it to see individual transactions
